## Introduction
This work derives closed-form parametric formulas for the Minkowski sums of convex bodies in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space with boundaries that are smooth and have all positive sectional curvatures at every point. Under these conditions, there is a unique relationship between the position of each boundary point and the surface normal. 

The main results are presented as two theorems:
+ Theorem 1 (Theorem 4.1 in the article): directly parameterizes the Minkowski sums using the unit normal vector at each surface point. Although simple to express mathematically, such a parameterization is not always practical to obtain computationally;
+ Theorem 2 (Theorem 4.3 in the article): derives a more useful parametric closed-form expression using the gradient that is not normalized. 

Demonstrations of the proposed closed-form Minkowski sums:

    <th>Gradient parameterization</th>

</table>


In the special case of two ellipsoids, the proposed expressions are identical to those derived previously using geometric interpretations. In order to examine the results, numerical validations and comparisons of the Minkowski sums between two superquadric bodies are conducted. 

Two applications are discussed and demonstrated:
+ Generate configuration space obstacles in motion planning problems;
+ Improve performance for optimization-based collision detection algorithms.
